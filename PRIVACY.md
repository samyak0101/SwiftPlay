# Privacy Policy for SwiftPlay

*Last Updated: June 1, 2023*

## Overview

SwiftPlay is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Information Collection

**We do not collect any personal data.** SwiftPlay operates entirely within your browser and does not:
- Collect personal information
- Track your browsing activity
- Use analytics or tracking tools
- Transmit data to external servers
- Store information outside your local browser storage

## Local Storage

SwiftPlay uses Chrome's local storage API exclusively to save your preferences, such as:
- Custom keyboard shortcuts
- Preferred playback speeds
- Speed increment values

This information never leaves your browser and is only used to provide the core functionality of the extension.

## Permissions

SwiftPlay requires several permissions to function properly:

- **activeTab**: To detect and modify video elements on the current page
- **storage**: To save your settings and preferences locally
- **scripting**: To inject code that controls video playback speed
- **alarms**: To maintain speed settings across page reloads
- **host permissions**: To work across all websites with video content

These permissions are used solely for the purpose of controlling video playback speed and maintaining your settings.

## Third-Party Services

SwiftPlay does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics providers, or external APIs. All functionality is self-contained within the extension.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.
